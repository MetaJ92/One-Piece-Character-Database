# One-Piece-Character-Database
This is a project I made to test out using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and React components within the Gatsby framework.
This application has two pages. One sorts information about 33 different characters from the One Piece series in a table. The headers can sort columns based on the name of the characters, the age, the height, the date of birth, the sea they were born in, and the blood type with just a click.
The second page is a quiz game based on all the information presented in the table. The page asks the user to match the information availible with the name of the character to earn points with each question being randomly generated.
